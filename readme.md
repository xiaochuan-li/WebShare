This project is made for the purpose of sharing files without USB keys or other complexe methods requiring registrations. All you need is the connection to the internet. A Web Service is availuable at <a href="http://39.101.205.118/">WebShare</a>. <strong>Attention!</strong> my web server is not so powerful, so it might not be a good idea to upload a heavy file.
